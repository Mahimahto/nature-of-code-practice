# FlameDance 

FlameDance is a mesmerizing fire simulation built using p5.js. It creates a dynamic flame effect with glowing particles, smooth motion, and natural fading.

## Features 
- Smoothly rising fire particles.
- Dynamic flame colors (red, orange, yellow hues).
- Glowing and fading effect for realism.
- Continuous fire motion using a particle system.

## How to Run 
1. Open `index.html` with a p5.js setup.
2. Make sure `FlameDance.js` is linked.
3. Watch the flames dance! 

## Code Overview 
- **Particle Class**: Defines individual flame particles.
- **ParticleSystem Class**: Manages multiple particles and their behavior.
- **setup() & draw()**: Controls the canvas and animation loop.

## Customization 
- Modify the `this.size` in `Particle` for bigger/smaller flames.
- Change the `lifespan` for longer/shorter fire duration.
- Adjust `addParticle()` rate for denser flames.

## Technologies Used 
- **JavaScript** (p5.js library)
- **HTML5 & Canvas**

Enjoy the flames!
