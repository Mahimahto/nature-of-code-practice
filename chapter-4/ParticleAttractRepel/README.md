# ParticleAttractRepel

## Description
This project **implements multiple attractors and repellers using a particle system**. Attractors pull particles in, while repellers push them away.

## Features
- **Particles move according to forces from multiple attractors and repellers**.
- Uses **inheritance and polymorphism** to define force objects without code duplication.
- The effect of forces **diminishes with distance**.

## How It Works
1. **Particles spawn at the center** of the screen.
2. **Attractors (blue) pull particles towards them**.
3. **Repellers (red) push particles away**.
4. **Particles respond to all forces at once**, creating dynamic movement.

## Controls
- No user interaction required; particles move autonomously.

## Future Improvements
- Allow users to place **custom attractors and repellers with clicks**.
- Add **different force strengths and behaviors** for variety.
