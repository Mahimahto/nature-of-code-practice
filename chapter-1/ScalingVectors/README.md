# Scaling Vectors

This is a simple p5.js project where you can visualize and scale 2D vectors. The vectors are drawn on a canvas, and their scaling factor can be adjusted using a slider. Additionally, there is a button to reset the vectors to their original size.

## Features:
- You can visualize multiple vectors.
- The scaling factor of the vectors can be adjusted using a slider.
- A reset button is available to restore vectors to their original values.

## How to Use:
1. Open the sketch in a p5.js editor (like the [p5.js Web Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/)).
2. Use the slider at the bottom to increase or decrease the scaling factor.
3. Click the "Reset Vectors" button to reset the vectors to their original size.

## Controls:
- **Slider**: Adjusts the scaling factor of the vectors.
- **Reset Button**: Resets the vectors to their original values.

## Requirements:
- p5.js library (for drawing and interacting with vectors).

## Example:
- A set of vectors with different magnitudes and directions are drawn.
- You can scale these vectors using the slider and observe the changes visually.
- You can reset the vectors to their original size with the reset button.
